# QuietlyStated - Overview

## What is this?

QuietlyStated is a tool that watches the internet for trends and news, then tells you what's important for your business.

Think of it like a smart assistant that:
- Watches Google Trends (what people are searching for)
- Reads news articles and blog posts
- Finds important numbers and facts
- Summarizes everything into easy-to-read insights

## What You Get

**Before a meeting**, you can ask: "What changed this week?" and get:
- Top search trends (what's hot, what's growing)
- Important topics from news and blogs
- Key statistics that matter

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Data Collection** - The system automatically fetches:
   - Google Trends data (search interest)
   - Google Alerts (news mentions)
   - Blog posts from websites you choose

2. **Processing** - It reads everything and finds:
   - Important numbers (like "sales up 15%")
   - Topics (like "TikTok Shop" or "email marketing")
   - Trends (what's going up or down)

3. **Insights** - It creates short summaries that tell you:
   - What happened
   - Why it matters
   - What you should do about it

4. **Access** - You can:
   - Run commands to get reports
   - Use a web API to query data
   - Schedule automatic updates

## What You Need

- A computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Python installed (the programming language)
- MongoDB installed (the database - where data is stored)
- Internet connection

**Good news**: You don't need any API keys to start! The basic version works with free services.
